Project Overview
The "Access to Project Table" project aims to develop and implement a secure and efficient access control mechanism for managing user interactions with the Project Overview table. The table contains critical project-related information that needs to be appropriately protected while ensuring that the right stakeholders have the access they need.
Objectives
Define Access Levels: Establish clear access levels for different user roles, such as Admin, Project Manager, Team Member, and Client/Stakeholder.
Ensure Data Security: Protect sensitive project data and ensure compliance with organizational and regulatory security standards.
Optimize User Experience: Provide seamless and intuitive access for users based on their roles, minimizing disruptions and maximizing productivity.
Implement Auditing & Logging: Maintain a robust system for tracking access and modifications to ensure accountability and transparency.
Key Features
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles that dictate their access level to the project table.
Granular Permissions: Control access at both the table and row levels to manage who can view, edit, or delete data.
Authentication & Authorization: Use secure mechanisms to validate user identity and authorize their access.
Data Filtering: Automatically filter data based on user roles to display only relevant project information.
Audit Trail: Log user actions for monitoring and reporting purposes.
Scope
Phase 1: Requirements gathering and analysis to identify different user roles and their access needs.
Phase 2: Design and develop the access control system, including UI components for managing permissions.
Phase 3: Testing and validation to ensure the system functions correctly and securely.
Phase 4: Deployment and training for end users.
Phase 5: Maintenance and continuous improvement based on user feedback.
Technology Stack
Backend: Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with integrated access control features.
Middleware: Authentication services (e.g., OAuth, JWT) for secure user verification.
Frontend: User-friendly interface to manage permissions and access levels.
Security: Implementation of data encryption, secure tokens, and other security measures.
